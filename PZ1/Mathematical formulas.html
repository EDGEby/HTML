	<h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
<h2>Linear Equations</h2>
<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form </p>
  <div class="advantages flex"> <span class="formula">ax + b = 0 </span> </div>
<p>where <span class="redB">a</span> and <span class="redB">b</span> are real numbers and
	<span class="redB">x</span> is a variable. 	This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. 
	Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
	Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="redB">x</span> so donâ€™t get 
	too locked into always seeing an <span class="redB">x</span> there.
<p>
<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
<p>
The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
</p>
  <div class="advantages flex"> <span class="formula">ax^2 + bx + c = 0 </span> </div>

<p>where <span class="redB">a</span>, <span class="redB">b</span>, <span class="redB">c</span> 
are known values and <span class="redB">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).
 Also, <span class="redB">a</span> can't be 0.
</p>

<h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

<span class="redB">[sign]</span>  (Pi) times the radius (<span class="redB">r</span> ) squared:

   <div class="advantages flex"> <span class="formula">A = [sign] [sign] r^2  </span> </div>

or, when you know the diameter (<span class="redB">D</span>):
   <div class="advantages flex"> <span class="formula">A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D^2  </span> </div>

or, when you know the circumference (<span class="redB">C</span>):
   <div class="advantages flex"> <span class="formula">A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign] </span> </div>

<h2>Intersection</h2>

The intersection of two sets <span class="redB">A</span> and <span class="redB">B</span>, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,

  <div class="advantages flex"> <span class="formula"> A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }  </span> </div>

That is, <span class="redB">x</span> is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if <span class="redB">x</span>
 is both an element of <span class="redB">A</span> and an element of <span class="redB">B</span>.
